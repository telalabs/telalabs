QQ Technologies embodies the ambition to democratize AI, making it accessible, understandable, and applicable for real-world scenarios. At its core, QQ Technologies hosts the QQ Framework, a sophisticated, high-performance foundation for building AI agents, designed to thrive in environments where speed, security, and scalability are paramount. QQ leverages the strengths of both Rust and Golang, combining Rust's safety and concurrency with Golang's simplicity and robustness to create a unique platform for AI development.

## Vision 
Our mission at QQ Tech is to:

Empower Developers: Provide tools and frameworks that allow developers of all levels to create, test, and deploy AI agents with ease.

Enhance Social Interaction: Utilize AI to analyze, engage, and enhance social media interactions, notably on platforms like Twitter, with agents that can understand and react to the nuances of human communication.

Promote Ethical AI: Ensure that our technology is developed with ethical considerations at the forefront, focusing on privacy, security, and responsible AI practices.

Drive Innovation: Continuously explore new methodologies, algorithms, and integrations to keep our tech stack at the cutting edge of AI development.

Our Vision is a world where AI agents are seamlessly integrated into everyday life, augmenting human capabilities and enriching digital experiences. We envision a future where AI not only responds but anticipates, learns, and adapts in real-time to the ever-evolving landscape of social media and beyond.

### [QQ - An Advanced Conversational LLM Framework](https://github.com/QQTechnologies/QQ)  
QQ is a modular, open-source conversational AI framework designed for the decentralized era. It is based on quantum computing and bridges the power of advanced AI with the flexibility of systems.  

Components: 
- An architecture based on plugins that has hot-swappable parts  
- Multi-provider LLM support, including OpenAI and bespoke connectors. 
- Semantic storage enabled by PostgreSQL and pgvector
- Extendable manager system with customized conversational behaviors.

### [QQKit - LLM Function Calling Framework](https://github.com/QQTechnologies/QQ)
QQKit is a Go and Rust package for constructing and managing LLM function calling tools. It offers a simple interface for developing AI-compatible functions and grouping them into toolkits.

Key features:
- An abstract tool interface for putting LLM-compatible features into practice
- Organizing relevant tools in a toolkit
- Pattern of functional possibilities for configuration
- Support for function parameters and returns in the JSON schema

## Extension Points
1. **LLM Providers**: Add new AI providers by implementing the LLM interface
```go
type Provider interface {
    GenerateCompletion(context.Context, CompletionRequest) (string, error)
    GenerateJSON(context.Context, JSONRequest, interface{}) error
    EmbedText(context.Context, string) ([]float32, error)
}
```

2. **Managers**: Create new behaviors by implementing the Manager interface
```go
type Manager interface {
    GetID() ManagerID
    GetDependencies() []ManagerID
    Process(state *state.State) error
    PostProcess(state *state.State) error
    Context(state *state.State) ([]state.StateData, error)
    Store(fragment *db.Fragment) error
    StartBackgroundProcesses()
    StopBackgroundProcesses()
    RegisterEventHandler(callback EventCallbackFunc)
    triggerEvent(eventData EventData)
}
```

### Plugin Architecture
- **Manager System**: Extend functionality through custom managers
  - Insight Manager: Extracts and maintains conversation insights
  - Personality Manager: Handles response behavior and style
  - Custom Managers: Add your own specialized behaviors

### State Management
- **Shared State System**: Centralized state management across components
  - Manager-specific data storage
  - Custom data injection
  - Cross-manager communication

### LLM Integration
- **Provider Abstraction**: Support for multiple LLM providers
  - Built-in OpenAI support
  - Extensible provider interface for custom LLMs
  - Configurable model selection per operation
  - Automatic fallback and retry handling

### Platform Support
- **Platform Agnostic Core**: 
  - Abstract conversation engine independent of platforms
  - Built-in support for CLI chat and Twitter
  - Extensible platform manager interface
  - Example implementations for new platform integration

### Storage Layer
- **Flexible Data Storage**:
  - PostgreSQL with pgvector for semantic search
  - GORM-based data models
  - Customizable fragment storage
  - Vector embedding support

### Toolkit/Function System
- **Pluggable Tool/Function Integration**:
  - Support for custom tool implementations
  - Built-in toolkit management
  - Function calling capabilities
  - Automatic tool response handling
  - State-aware tool execution
